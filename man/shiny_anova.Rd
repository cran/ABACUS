\title{Shiny App to Demonstrate Analysis of Variance}
\usage{
shiny_anova()
}
\value{
The outcomes are presented in several tabs.
    \item{Population}{contains the density plots of three populations and
    rug plots of the sample units randomly drawn from these populations.
    It also shows the population parameter values chosen by the user.}
    \item{Sample}{contains the dot plots and box plots of three samples drawn
    randomly from the three populations and rug plots of the sample units.
    It also includes the estimates of mean and standard deviation of three samples.}
    \item{SS & MS}{contains the bar plots showing the between and within sum of squares (SS)
    and mean squares (MS) as well as the proportion of between and within SS over total SS.}
    \item{Test Statistic}{contains the plots showing the mean difference between groups.
    and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
    The tab also contains the distribution of the test statistic \code{F},
    the observed value of the test statistic and probabilities
    under the given value of the Type 1 error}
    \item{Summary}{includes the summary of the sampled data and outcomes
    from the one-way analysis of variance. Different sections are:
    (1) Hypothesis, highlighting the null and alternative hypothesis;
    (2) Sample, tabulating the full sampled data;
    (3) Summary Statistics, summarising the summary information of three samples;
    (4) Model Outputs, the outputs from fitting the analysis of variance model.
    The section also present the multiple comparision of means using
    Tukey's Honest Significant Differences test.
    This section represents standard R outputs based on fitting an \code{\link{lm}} function.}

\description{
An interactive Shiny app to demonstrate Analysis of Variance.
}
\details{
The interactive Shiny app demonstrates the principles of Analysis of Variance.
    The true parameter values are provided by the user.
    The user changes sample characteristics, distribution function and simulation features
    and explores the influence of these changes on the hypothesis testing using principles of analysis of variance.

    The left panel includes the user inputs for \strong{Simulation Features}, \strong{Population Parameters},
    \strong{Sample Characteristics}, and \strong{Distribution Function}.
    To use the app at first instance, just click the \code{Update} button.
    To alter the input values, edit the text box or move the point on the slider and
    explore the changes in different tabs (see below).

    To obtain identical outcomes in a separate run of the app,
    set a common seed value at the bottom of the left panel and click \code{Update}.
    All subsequent updates will produce identical results provided other inputs are identical.
    The seed value is ignored when the option \code{check the box to update instantly} is selected.
